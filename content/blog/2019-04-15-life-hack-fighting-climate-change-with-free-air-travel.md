If every airline employee gave passes to just 2 friends who would otherwise have purchased a round tip once a month, there would be (120,000 x 2 people x 2 tickets x 12 months) = 5,760,000 fewer tickets sold. Assuming all smaller Boeing 737s @ 150 seats that is 38,400 fewer flights (critically these are flights people would otherwise have paid for).



According to a quick google search the average commercial flight is 480mi, probably based on travel in europe but we will take it - chicago to denver is 920mi and travelmath.com says that is 516lb of CO2 emissions ~ 269lb for a shorter flight.



(269lb x 38,400) / 2000lb per ton equals 5164 tons that could be saved by giving your friends free vacations! Not to mention fewer profits going to shareholders (parasites who want free money just for 'investing' their extra money they don't need).
