The internet is already full of Ultimate Instant Pot Beans recipes, but with any cooking that doesn't involve chemistry I rarely work off single recipes. Instead, I'll try to read & distill as many as possible into some set of principles and work off those.

This is my attempt to collect my own past experience in one place- I'll add more as I iterate. These aren't recipes so much as results. There will be no stories of cooking beans with my grandmother or even pictures of beans to scroll through, either. Just results.


### Black beans
Since 2006 [this](http://vegweb.com/recipes/black-beans-rice-cuban-style) has been my go-to base recipe for black beans. 

#### 29-04-2019 
- Approx. 1-1/4 cups dry black beans (half of a 1-lb. bag?).
- Beans were soaked for around 24 hours ðŸ˜¬
- Water: 2-1/2 cups (so about 2:1 for the dry beans)
- For flavoring I sautÃ©ed an onion and added 2 tsp. garlic powder (out of real garlic) and 1 tsp each cumin/oregano. Salted after cooking. Flavor was good.
- Cooking time: 10 minutes on high pressure with quick release.


_Result:_ The beans were cooked but watery. I wanted a saucier bean so I used a masher to mix them up a bit. In the future I'd probably cut the water or skip soaking.

#### 07-04-2019 - Beans & Rice
- 1 cup black beans [unsoaked].
- 1 cup brown rice.
- 5 cups liquid (3/ broth, 2/rice)
  - This is a 4:1 ratio for the beans + 1:1 for the rice.
- For flavoring I sautÃ©ed an onion, 4 garlic cloves, a chopped green pepper and and added 1/2 tsp. each cumin/oregano. Flavor was good but needed more later.
- Cooking time:
  - 24 minutes on high pressure
  - 10 minutes 'natural release' 

_Result:_ Beans were well done. Very watery upon opening, but it thickened up later. The bell peppers added a nice flavor but were basically gone after cooking. Some people maintain that you can't skip soaking, but instant pot people don't seem to mind this. It's nice to be able to cook them together- convenient and you aren't left with some leftover rice. The main recipes I used to arrive at this ratio were [here](https://frommybowl.com/instant-pot-rice-beans/) and [here](https://myplantbasedfamily.com/2016/08/10/instant-pot-black-beans-rice/).
