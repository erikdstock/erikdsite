> \[O]n the first thanksgiving the colonists said to the Indians MAKE DESSERT. The native Americans then went like "let's cover corn kernels with butter and cook it till it pops! Yay!" then the colonists tried it and were like "what's this stuff?!?!?!?!" and the natives said "it's popped-corn" which turned into popcorn

Popcorn - itâ€™s everywhere, and it just keeps getting worse. It always seems to cost more than it used to. You don't get a free refill except on the jumbo size.  First no one is passing the bag and then of course when the movie is almost over you end up stuck holding it.  Your coworker made some in the microwave and now the whole place smells like popcorn. Dentists are saying we should stop eating it _completely._ And of course there is popcorn lung.

And _where is the butter?_ Most of the problems above are too big, dealing with economics and how we treat our fellow human beings, and I omitted issues around the teeth entirely. But after 400 years popcorn butter can be better. 

Here is the problem: We don't want too much or too little butter- we want a reasonable amount, and we want it distributed pretty evenly. Existing butter pumps don't work for this, and require a complex chain of steps performed under pressure (assuming the movie is about to start and there is a long line) so the typical result is a big glob of butter on the top and dry kernels underneath.

#### It wasn't always this bad.

My senior year of high school the local theater moved the butter pump to the self-serve area next to the pop dispensers. This was great news for me. I was a vegan, dumpster-diving punk, most of the theater staff were friends of mine, they used rigid cardboard buckets for popcorn and offered free refills on all sizes: The perfect place to grab a bucket out of the garbage and spend the day watching movies. I can still remember the relief after getting access to the supplies closet of scanning the label on the huge sack of butter oil for obvious animal products- all chemicals, plausible deniability.

All of this is to say that none of the conditions that made this popcorn so great (buckets, refills, public butter, friends behind counter) are in place at that theater. Moreover I am not so sure the unlimited butter tap meant consistently better outcomes. I was 17 and could eat like a goat without consequence. I would bet it just as often lead to ruined popcorn and messes that the workers had to deal with. Better, then, to keep it behind the counter.

#### Austerity goes to the movies

The easiest way to avoid this issue was to fill the popcorn only half way, pump a _little_ bit of hot butter onto it while shaking the container, and then repeating once full. In the year 2019 popcorn comes in flimsy paper bags which cannot be shaken, and workers are too rushed and stressed to be going back and forth between the pump and the popcorn box. Even requesting what used to be standard practice in many theaters now makes you sound like a jerk.

#### A new nozzle for an old dispenser

This is a design for a new, \_injector-style\_ budder nozzle. Instead of working like a spigot, pumping and dumping the butter on only the top kernels, this nozzle is an eight-to-ten-inch needle, only a few millimeters in diameter. Up and down this needle are thousands or millions of extremely tiny holes, each one barely larger in diameter than a single butter particle.
