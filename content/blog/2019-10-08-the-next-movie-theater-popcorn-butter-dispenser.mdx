\[dramatic opening about the impact of cinema on culture]

The official food of movies, popcorn has been nearly as impactful on human culture. It always seems to cost more than it used to. You don't get a free refill except on the jumbo size.  At the beginning of the movie someone isn't passing it to you and then of course later when it's almost gone you end up holding the bag and no one else wants to take a turn holding it.  Your coworker made some in the microwave and now the whole place smells like popcorn. And of course there is popcorn lung.

And _where is the butter?_ Many of the problems above are just symptoms of a deeper malaise and cannot be addressed on their own. After 100 years popcorn butter can be better. 

Here is the problem: We don't want too much or too little- we want a reasonable amount, and we want it on every kernel. Existing butter pumps don't work for this, and require a complex chain of steps performed under pressure (assuming the movie is about to start and there is a long line) so the typical result is a big glob of butter on the top and dry kernels underneath.

Theater workers and corporate boards have tried to address this in several ways. The most straightforward method, which I would argue worked well in the past, was to fill the popcorn only half way, pump a _little_ bit of hot butter onto it while shaking the container, and then to repeat once full. Like many things this approach was ruined by austerity. Rather than nice cardboard buckets, 2019 popcorn comes in flimsy paper bags which cannot be shaken, and workers are too rushed and stressed to be going back and forth between the pump and the popcorn box. Even requesting what used to be standard practice in many theaters now makes you sound like a jerk.

In high school the local theater (where all my friends worked) turned the butter pump over to the people, putting it next to the soda machines in a major display of public trust.
