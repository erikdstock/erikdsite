\[dramatic opening about the impact of cinema on culture]

The official food of movies, popcorn has been nearly as impactful on human culture. It always seems to cost more than it used to. You don't get a free refill except on the jumbo size.  At the beginning of the movie someone isn't passing it to you and then of course later when it's almost gone you end up holding the bag and no one else wants to take a turn holding it.  Your coworker made some in the microwave and now the whole place smells like popcorn. And of course there is popcorn lung.

And _where is the butter?_ Most of the problems above are too big, dealing with economics and how we treat our fellow human beings, and I omitted issues around the teeth entirely. But after 100 years popcorn butter can be better. 

Here is the problem: We don't want too much or too little- we want a reasonable amount, and we want it distributed pretty evenly. Existing butter pumps don't work for this, and require a complex chain of steps performed under pressure (assuming the movie is about to start and there is a long line) so the typical result is a big glob of butter on the top and dry kernels underneath.

#### It wasn't always this bad.

In high school the local theater turned the butter pump over to the people, putting it next to the soda machines in a major display of public trust. This was great news for me. I was a vegan, dumpster-diving punk, most of the theater staff were friends of mine, they used rigid cardboard buckets for popcorn and offered free refills on all sizes: The perfect place to grab a bucket out of the garbage and spend the day watching _Meet the Parents_ several times and being a general prick to several waves of moviegoers until your friends finally convince you to leave. (I can still remember the relief after getting access to the supplies closet of scanning the label on the huge sack of butter oil for obvious animal products- all chemicals, plausible deniability.)

All of this is to say that none of the conditions that made this popcorn so great (buckets, refills, public butter, friends behind counter) are in place at that theater. Moreover I am not so sure the unlimited butter tap meant consistently better outcomes. I was 17 and could eat like a goat without consequence. I would bet it just as often lead to ruined popcorn and messes that the workers had to deal with. Better, then, to keep it behind the counter.

#### Austerity goes to the movies

The easiest way to avoid this issue was to fill the popcorn only half way, pump a _little_ bit of hot butter onto it while shaking the container, and then repeating once full. In the year 2019 popcorn comes in flimsy paper bags which cannot be shaken, and workers are too rushed and stressed to be going back and forth between the pump and the popcorn box. Even requesting what used to be standard practice in many theaters now makes you sound like a jerk.
