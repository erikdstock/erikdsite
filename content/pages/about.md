title: I'm Erik

I was born and raised outside Chicago and spent the first decade of my adult life there. Now I'm a software engineer living in New York. I mostly work in web things, particularly with ruby, javascript and scala.

I was born in the year 1984. Around the 1997 I taught myself to like roller coasters and for the next few years I planned to study engineering and become a roller coaster designer. 4 years later I was a vegan anarchist punk rocker, and I've been oscillating between these two ideals since then.
